        <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Half-Pipe Personal Project</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Preface</h2>
        <p>It was Summer 2018, just prior my starting at California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo in the coming Fall, and a very strange time in my life. I already call San Luis Obispo county my home, meaning there was no need to stress about moving, but there were many other imminent stressors I was not prepared to face. Someone very close to me was diagnosed with cancer just a week or two after my decision to stay home for school, and this changed the way I think about the world as a whole — this came to be a year-long period of my life that I can quite easily say was one of the most emotional I have met so far, and an ordeal I cannot wish upon anyone.</p>
        
        <div style="padding-top: 8px;">
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>In the face of adversity, I took to dealing with emotions by doing something I loved — creating. With skateboarding and BMX biking being something I have been invested in for the majority of my life, and having no fear of getting my hands dirty, I took on a project to build a half-pipe in the backyard of my home. Starting with stepping out the overall size of the build, I was able to get a general idea and I went on to create technical drafts of the ramp, keeping in mind the typical sizes of plywood and other materials in an attempt to maximize efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Ground</h2>
        <p>After creating the drafts and acquiring materials, I began breaking ground, first by levelling the ground and adding paving stones for a foundation. After the foundational pave stones were added, I began laying out the framework for the flat space between the two quarter pipes.</p>

        <h2>Creating the Ramps</h2>
        <p>Upon completing the foundation of the ramp, I began creating the ramp frames. Following along with the designs, I cut the transition/outer frame and inner frame pieces, then got them put together.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 32px">Completion</h2>
        <p>After much work, the ramp was ultimately completed after laying two layers of plywood down and installing other components. So, not only was there satisfaction upon completing such a large project all on my own (aside from some assistance from Julep), but it acted as a healthy distraction from other things in my life — when I create, the project is something that remains on my mind until it is planned entirely or on its way toward completion, so this project being as large and time-consuming as it got me in a great creative headspace, and it was ultimately a project that I appreciated especially at this time in my life.</p>
