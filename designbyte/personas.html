        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>The concept of personas involves the creation of a fictional set of archetypal users for a system. The users are given stories, such as age, education, background, and lifestyle. The creation of personas aids with getting into the mindset of a user in order to better create, test, and critique a system.</p>

        <p>Good sets of personas have variety, containing identities of a few average users of varying experience levels. This allows for better drafting of requirements for a system by associating the product with a user and a base of users.</p>

        <p>Let's try it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-user full-size"></i>
            <h4>Joe</h4>
            <ul class="persona_about">
                <li>Web developer</li>
                <li>Likes design</li>
                <li>Certified in computer science</li>
                <li>Wants to start a site of his own</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is a start but it feels impersonal and bare. We want to create an identity we can associate with to remind us of who we are designing for.</p>

        <p>More often than not, when designing a system for a long time it is difficult to stop thinking like a designer or a developer and think like a user might. Creating rich personas can assist with thinking more in line with a real user.</p>
